        <h3>What Is The "D.B. Cooper Hijacking"? </h3>
            <p>D.B Cooper is a media epithet for the mysterious man who hijacked Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 305, a Boeing 727 aircraft, in the U.S.A on November 24, 1971. During the flight from Portland, Oregon, to Seattle, Washington, after revealing he was armed with a bomb he asked the flight attendant for 200,000 in ransom money (equivalent to $1,500,000 in 2024).</p>

        <h4>Who Is D.B. Cooper?</h4>
            <p>The hijacker gave himself the alias of Dan Cooper but one of the reporters confused him with another suspect thus making him be called D.B Cooper.</p>

        <h4>What Happened?</h4>
            <p>For 45 years after the hijacking, the Federal Bureau of Investigation maintained an active investigation and built an extensive case file, but ultimately did not reach any definitive conclusions. The crime remains the only unsolved case of air piracy in the history of commercial aviation. the FBI speculates he didn't survive his jump due to him jumping in the woods and all the money that was found after the hijacking made many believe he did not get the time to spend it.</p>
