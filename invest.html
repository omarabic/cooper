        <h2 style="text-align: center;"><b>INVESTIGATION</b></h2>
    </div>

<div class="p1">
    <h2>Witness Interviews</h2> 
    <p>Investigators interviewed passengers, crew members, and airport personnel who had contact with Cooper before, during, and after the hijacking. They collected descriptions of Cooper's appearance, behavior, and interactions with others.</p>      
</div>
    
<div class="p2">    
    <h2>Forensic Analysis</h2> 
    <p>The FBI conducted forensic analysis of physical evidence recovered from the plane, including fingerprints, DNA, and any items left behind by Cooper. They also analyzed the ransom money for fingerprints and serial numbers.</p>
        
</div>   
    
    <div class="p3">
    <h2>Search Operations</h2>
    <p> Law enforcement agencies conducted extensive ground and aerial searches of the areas where Cooper was believed to have parachuted from the plane. These searches covered rugged terrain in Washington and Oregon but yielded no conclusive evidence.</p>
       
    </div>
    

    <div class="p4">
    <h2>Cooperation with Airlines</h2>
    <p> Investigators worked closely with Northwest Orient Airlines to gather information about the flight, passengers, and crew members. They examined flight manifests, ticket sales records, and maintenance logs for any potential leads.</p>
     
</div>

<div class="p5">
    <h2>Public Appeals and Tips</h2>
    <p> The FBI made public appeals for information and tips from the public, urging anyone with information about Cooper or the hijacking to come forward. They received thousands of tips, which were followed up and investigated.</p>
        
</div>
    

<div class="p6">
    <h2>Profile Development</h2>
    <p> Behavioral analysts and profilers within the FBI developed profiles of potential suspects based on the available evidence and witness statements. These profiles helped guide the investigation and prioritize leads.</p>
       
</div>
    

<div class="p7">
    <h2>Continued Monitoring and Review:</h2>
    <p> The investigation into the DB Cooper case remained open for decades, with periodic reviews of the evidence and potential leads. Advances in forensic technology and investigative techniques were also used to re-examine the case over time.</p>


</div>


<div class="p8">
    <h2>The Lasting Impact</h2>
    <p>Despite these efforts, the identity and fate of DB Cooper remain one of the most enduring mysteries in American criminal history, and the case remains officially unsolved.</p>
